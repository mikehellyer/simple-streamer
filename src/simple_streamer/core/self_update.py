"""Downloading and launching an update, once the user has asked for it.

Simple-Streamer never does this on its own — check_for_update() only ever
notifies. Everything here only runs after an explicit "Update" click.

The installer ends up running with the user's (or, on Linux, root's)
privileges, so it's checked on the way: the link has to point at this
app's own GitHub releases, the download has to actually come from
GitHub, and on Linux the .deb has to really be the simple-streamer
package at the expected version before it's handed to pkexec/apt.
